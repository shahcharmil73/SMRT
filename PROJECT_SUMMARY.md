## üöÄ Ready-to-Run Features

### Query Examples That Work
- "What is the total revenue?" ‚Üí Returns calculated revenue from actual data
- "Show me all customers" ‚Üí Lists all customer records
- "What are the top products?" ‚Üí Shows best-selling products by quantity
- "How many premium customers?" ‚Üí Counts customer types
- "Order status distribution" ‚Üí Shows Processing/Shipped/Delivered counts
- "Generate business summary report" ‚Üí Creates comprehensive report

### Report Generation
- **Text Reports**: Formatted business summaries
- **Visual Charts**: Revenue by customer, product sales, order status pie charts
- **Export Ready**: Structured data for further analysis

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Quick Start (Recommended)
1. **Install Prerequisites**: Node.js, Python 3.9+, Docker Desktop
2. **Start Backend**: `docker-compose up backend`
